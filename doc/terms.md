# Terms

-   Arms
    -   Blocks of code in a `match` or `if` segment
-   Scalar Types
    -   A type representing a single value (i.e. integers, floating point
        numbers, booleans, and characters).
-   Compound Types
    -   Types that can group multiple values into one type. Two primitive types
        are tuples and arrays.
-   Parameters
    -   Variables defined in a function signature
-   Arguments
    -   Values passed into a function during invocation
-   Expression
    -   Instructions that evaluate to a resulting value
-   Statement
    -   Instructions that perform an action and don't return a value
-   Stack
    -   Stores values in the order it gets them (last in, first out)
    -   Data stored on the stack must be a known, fixed size
    -   Adding data is called "pusing onto the stack"
    -   Removing data is called "popping off the stack"
-   Heap
    -   Stores unknown sized data (can grow over time)
    -   The OS will allocate a section of memory and return a pointer
    -   This is called "allocating on the heap" or just "allocating"
    -   Pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating
    -   Because a pointer is a known, fixed size, the pointer can be stored on
        the stack
    -   When you want the actual data, the pointer must be followed to the data
-   Owner
    -   Each heap value has a variable called its owner
    -   When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped (memory is
        free'd)
-   Move
    -   When a heap value is moved from one variable to another (ownership is
        moved)
    -   Does not occur on types that implement the `Copy` trait
-   Borrowing
    -   When a function parameter uses a reference to a heap value. This
        prevents a `move`, causing the value to be unusable in the calling
        function.
-   Structs
    -   A named type that contains different named fields with types
-   Module system
    -   Made up of packages, crates, modules, and paths
-   Package
    -   One or more crates that provide functionality
-   Crate
    -   A binary or library within a package
    -   A package with `src/lib.rs` has a library crate
    -   A package with `src/main.rs` has a binary crate
-   Crate Root
    -   Source file that the compiler starts with in a crate
-   Trait Bound
    -   When a generic type parameter is bound to specific traits
-   Blanket Implementation
    -   Conditionally applied trait on any type that satisfies trait bounds
        ```
        impl<T: Display> ToString for T {
          // --snip--
        }
        ```
-   LifeTime
    -   Scope for which a reference is valid
-   consuming adapters
    -   Methods that call `next` on an iterator. They will take ownership of
        the iterator.
